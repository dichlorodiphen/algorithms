# Algorithms

A collection of algorithm implementations from *Algorithms* by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. Note that this will not be exhaustive; it serves more as a convenient way to sync my work across devices.

## To-do

* [ ] Set up unit testing with JUnit

## Chapter 4: Graphs

### 4.1: Undirected graphs

* Find connected components in an undirected graph ([ch4/ConnectedComponents.java](ch4/ConnectedComponents.java))

### 4.2: Directed graphs

* Reverse a digraph ([ch4/ReverseDigraph.java](ch4/ReverseDigraph.java))
* Find shortest path in a digraph using BFS ([ch4/ShortestPath.java](ch4/ShortestPath.java))
* Find strongly connected components in a digraph using the Kosaraju-Sharir algorithm ([ch4/KosarajuSharir.java](ch4/KosarajuSharir.java))
